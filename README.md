# Singleton Design Pattern in C#

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Singleton design pattern in C#. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Implementation Details

The Singleton pattern is implemented in the `Singleton` class, which follows the lazy initialization approach. It ensures that the instance is created only when it is first requested.
